Now let's get a little more advanced with bash.  To do this I'm going to show
how multiple commands can be saved in a file, and called later.  I will also
cover how to redirect the output and input for these commands in a file (called
scripts).  Finally I will show how to use pipes to get multiple commands on the
same line to pass information between them.
